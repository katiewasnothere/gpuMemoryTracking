Usage: nvprof [options] [application] [application-arguments]
Options:
       --aggregate-mode <on|off>
                        Turn on/off aggregate mode for events and metrics specified
                        by subsequent "--events" and "--metrics" options. Those
                        event/metric values will be collected for each domain instance,
                        instead of the whole device. Allowed values:
                        	on - turn on aggregate mode (default)
                        	off - turn off aggregate mode

       --analysis-metrics
                        Collect profiling data that can be imported to Visual Profiler's
                        "analysis" mode. Note: Use "--export-profile" to specify
                        an export file.

       --annotate-mpi <off|openmpi|mpich>
                        Automatically annotate MPI calls with NVTX markers. Specify
                        the MPI implementation installed on your machine. Currently,
                        Open MPI and MPICH implementations are supported. By default,
                        this option is off.

       --concurrent-kernels <on|off>
                        Turn on/off concurrent kernel execution. If concurrent kernel
                        execution is off, all kernels running on one device will
                        be serialized. Allowed values:
                        	on - turn on concurrent kernel execution (default)
                        	off - turn off concurrent kernel execution

       --continuous-sampling-interval <interval>
                        Set the continuous mode sampling interval in milliseconds.

       --cpu-thread-tracing <on|off>
                        Collect information about CPU thread API activity.
                        Allowed values:
                        	on  - turn on CPU thread API tracing
                        	off - turn off CPU thread API tracing (default)

       --dependency-analysis
                        Generate event dependency graph for host and device activities
                        and run dependency analysis.

       --device-buffer-size <size in MBs>
                        Set the device memory size (in MBs) reserved for storing
                        profiling data for non-CDP operations, especially for concurrent
                        kernel tracing, for each buffer on a context. The default
                        value is 8MB. The size should be a positive integer.

       --device-cdp-buffer-size <size in MBs>
                        Set the device memory size (in MBs) reserved for storing
                        profiling data for CDP operations for each buffer on a context.
                        The default value is 8MB. The size should be a positive
                        integer.

       --devices <device ids>
                        Change the scope of subsequent "--events", "--metrics", "--query-events"
                        and "--query-metrics" options.
                        Allowed values:
                        	all - change scope to all valid devices
                        	comma-separated device IDs - change scope to specified
                        devices

       --event-collection-mode <mode>
                        Choose event collection mode for all events/metrics Allowed
                        values:
                        	kernel - events/metrics are collected only for durations
                        of kernel executions (default)
                        	continuous - events/metrics are collected for duration
                        of application. This is not applicable for non-tesla devices.
                        This mode is compatible only with NVLink events/metrics.
                        This modeis incompatible with "--profile-all-processes"
                        or "--profile-child-processes" or "--replay-mode kernel"
                        or "--replay-mode application".

  -e,  --events <event names>
                        Specify the events to be profiled on certain device(s). Multiple
                        event names separated by comma can be specified. Which device(s)
                        are profiled is controlled by the "--devices" option. Otherwise
                        events will be collected on all devices.
                        For a list of available events, use "--query-events".
                        Use "--events all" to profile all events available for each
                        device.
                        Use "--devices" and "--kernels" to select a specific kernel
                        invocation.

       --kernel-latency-timestamps <on|off>
                        Turn on/off collection of kernel latency timestamps, namely
                        queued and submitted. The queued timestamp is captured when
                        a kernel launch command was queued into the CPU command
                        buffer. The submitted timestamp denotes when the CPU command
                        buffer containing this kernel launch was submitted to the
                        GPU. Turning this option on may incur an overhead during
                        profiling. Allowed values:
                        	on - turn on collection of kernel latency timestamps
                        	off - turn off collection of kernel latency timestamps
                        (default)

       --kernels <kernel path syntax>
                        Change the scope of subsequent "--events", "--metrics" options.
                        The syntax is as follows:
                        	<kernel name>
                        	Limit scope to given kernel name.
                        or
                        	<context id/name>:<stream id/name>:<kernel name>:<invocation>
                        The context/stream IDs, names, kernel name and invocation
                        can be regular expressions. Empty string matches any number
                        or characters. If <context id/name> or <stream id/name>
                        is a positive number, it's strictly matched against the
                        CUDA context/stream ID. Otherwise it's treated as a regular
                        expression and matched against the context/stream name specified
                        by the NVTX library. If the invocation count is a positive
                        number, it's strictly matched against the invocation of
                        the kernel. Otherwise it's treated as a regular expression.
                        Example: --kernels "1:foo:bar:2" will profile any kernel
                        whose name contains "bar" and is the 2nd instance on context
                        1 and on stream named "foo".

  -m,  --metrics <metric names>
                        Specify the metrics to be profiled on certain device(s).
                        Multiple metric names separated by comma can be specified.
                        Which device(s) are profiled is controlled by the "--devices"
                        option. Otherwise metrics will be collected on all devices.
                        For a list of available metrics, use "--query-metrics".
                        Use "--metrics all" to profile all metrics available for
                        each device.
                        Use "--devices" and "--kernels" to select a specific kernel
                        invocation. 
                        Note: "--metrics all" does not include some metrics which
                        are needed for Visual Profiler's source level analysis.
                        For that, use "--analysis-metrics".

       --pc-sampling-period <period>
                        Specify PC Sampling period in cycles,  at which the sampling
                        records will be dumped. Allowed values for the period are
                        integers between 5 to 31 both inclusive.
                        This will set the sampling period to (2^period) cycles
                        Default value is a number between 5 and 12 based on the setup.Note:
                        Only available for GM20X+.
                        

       --profile-all-processes
                        Profile all processes launched by the same user who launched
                        this nvprof instance. Note: Only one instance of nvprof
                        can run with this option at the same time. Under this mode,
                        there's no need to specify an application to run.

                        Enable/disable profiling from the start of the application.
                        If it's disabled, the application can use {cu,cuda}Profiler{Start,Stop}
                        to turn on/off profiling. Allowed values:
                        	on - enable profiling from start (default)

       --query-events
                        List all the events available on the device(s). Device(s)
                        queried can be controlled by the "--devices" option.

       --query-metrics
                        List all the metrics available on the device(s). Device(s)
                        queried can be controlled by the "--devices" option.

       --replay-mode <mode>
                        Choose replay mode used when not all events/metrics can be
                        collected in a single run. Allowed values:
                        	disabled - replay is disabled, events/metrics couldn't
                        be profiled will be dropped
                        	kernel - each kernel invocation is replayed (default)
                        	application - the entire application is replayed.
                        This modeis incompatible with "--profile-all-processes"
                        or "profile-child-processes".

  -a,  --source-level-analysis <source level analysis names>
                        Specify the source level metrics to be profiled on a certain
                        kernel invocation. Use "--devices" and "--kernels" to select
                        a specific kernel invocation. Allowed values: one or more
                        of the following, separated by commas

                        Note: Timeout starts counting from the moment the CUDA driver
                        is initialized. If the application doesn't call any CUDA
                        APIs, timeout won't be triggered.

       --track-memory-allocations <on|off>
                        Turn on/off tracking of memory operations, which involves
                        recording timestamps, memory size, memory type and program
                        counters of the memory allocations and frees. Turning this
                        option on may incur an overhead during profiling. Allowed
                        values:
                        	on - turn on tracking of memory allocations and
